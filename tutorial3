# WARNING READ OTHER TUTORIALS FIRST AND READ THIS THEN.

Welcome to your 3rd tutorial of Roblox Lua! Today you will learn variables and player.
So lets get started!
To start with, lets do variables.
The format for variable is, local {variable name} = {not necessary but if you want it to have a value then you can.}
But remove the brackets.
So now you know how to make a variable, lets do player now.
So to mention a player do, local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
You can use this for stuff like, print(player.Name.." has joined the game!")
The 2 dots represent something that even I dont know but its there, use it for other stuff too.
Well, if you understand this tutorial then, see you on the next tutorial!
