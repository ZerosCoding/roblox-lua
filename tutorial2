# WARNING READ FIRST TUTORIAL BEFORE READING THIS.

Welcome to your second tutorial of roblox studio lua!
Last time you learned how to make scripts!
This tutorial I will tell you how to use the print function.

So in script or local script (When you insert a script or local script.) you should see print("Hello World!").
So what that ACTUALLY does is it sends what you print in the console, for example I wanna write print("I have joined the game!") then i'd do that.
But the format of the print function is,
print("")
In the strings write anything and it will send to the console, give it a try.
If you have, and you understand this tutorial then, I will see you in the next tutorial!
